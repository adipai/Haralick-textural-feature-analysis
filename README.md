# haralick-textural-feature-analysis

The Haralick texture features are used for image classification. These features capture information about the patterns that emerge in patterns of texture. The features are calculated by construction of a co-occurrence matrix that is traditionally computationally expensive. Once the co-occurrence matrix has been constructed, calculations of the 13 features are done.
