# haralick-textural-feature-analysis

The Haralick texture features are used for image classification. These features capture information about the patterns that emerge in patterns of texture. The features are calculated by construction of a co-occurrence matrix that is traditionally computationally expensive. Once the co-occurrence matrix has been constructed, calculations of the 13 features are done.



## Angular Second Momentum
The ASM measures the local uniformity of the gray levels. When pixels are very similar, the ASM value will be large

## Contrast
Contrast (Moment 2 or standard deviation) is a measure of intensity or grey level variations between the reference pixel and its neighbour. Large contrast reflects large intensity differences in GLCM.

## Correlation
Correlation feature shows the linear dependency of gray level values in the cooccurrence matrix

## Sum of squares: variance
Sum of squares, puts relatively high weights on the elements that differ from the value of matrix.

## Inverse Difference moment
Inverse difference moment is the measure of local homogeneity

## Sum average
Sum average measures the sum of the average of all grey levels.

## Sum variance
Variance is a measure of heterogeneity and is strongly correlated to first order statistical variable such as standard deviation. Variance increases when the gray level values differ from their mean.

## Sum entropy
Sum Entropy, is a measure of non-uniformity in the image or the complexity of the texture.

## Entropy
Entropy measures the disorder of an image and it achieves its largest value when all elements in P matrix are equal

## Difference variance
The difference variance measure is defined as the variance of pxâˆ’y, in a manner similar to its sum counterpart

## Difference entropy
The Difference Entropy is a measure of randomness or lack of structure or order in the image contrast.

## Information measures of correlation
Information measures of correlation is correlations of various parameters measured using different techniques
